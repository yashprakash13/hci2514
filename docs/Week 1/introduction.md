# Week 1 - Introduction

## Instructor's Design Goals:

- Give you a strange, confusing, pushing you outside your comfort zone interaction with technology and the class. 
- Teach you about another technology
    * Why? Not completely sure, but possibly…
- Give you a taste of what Design & HCI are like – ill-defined problems, unsure what to do, no one giving you the 'right' answer, and you trying to get something of value from it.
- Let you introduce yourself and bond and share over the suffering :D
- What else?


## Prompts for Doing Introductions

### DesignGoals:

- Create a sense of familiarity & community in the class, 
- Start conversations that can lead to professional & personal connections, discussions, opportunities
- Try out ideas for conversation starters that you don't know how effective they will be
- Tell people things about you, -What other goals could be useful?

### Prototype(s):

- Share Name/LinkedIn/Website
- Answer some prompts (or make up your own): 
    * What was my favourite course at U of T (and why?)
    * What do I want to get out of this course?
    * What's some random personal/fun fact about me, like a hobby, or something different, or even something 'boring' that will spark conversation.
- Throw out another idea and just tell people what you're doing, ask for feedback!
- What else? 


## Reading

- Read the HCI book chapter 5 from [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V6iBpPV5Vr6vp8TOj2YHJzCHcdSb7_gqNl66nf_RCSo/edit?usp=sharing)
- Mention your ideas, thoughts, questions, answers to someone else's questions in the comments in the doc as you read
- Write your weekly reflection after you're done with it :)
