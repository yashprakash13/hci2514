3. Add a copy of your contributions and weekly reflections to the [DigitalBrain folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gqxRqJjyrJsZgcBGBrzSiHrd7KEuLYxU?usp=sharing) as well.


## Things you should've done by the end of the course

1. Compiled all your weekly reflections neatly with your name in the Digital Brain document, in *Joseph's* words:

> Digital Brain is a one stop place for you to keep track of everything you learned in the course, what links are useful, what your reflections are. So put your planning & reflections into the weekly Gdoc, AND #zzDuplicateCopyPaste them into your Digital Brain. Create a Gdoc called " Suhyeon Yoo #zzDigitalBrain" and that's hwere you put all the information yo uwant to keep track off. And if in 1 month, 3 months, 2 years you were to come back and try to refresh on what you'd learned, that Doc should make it easy for you to do it.

2. Posted all the contributions you've made throughout the course towards helping with organisation, doing things during the lectures, helping your classmates through various technologies and mediums, etc, in your own [Contributions](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xhJ713a8js2I-q-wpxFBcTqi0qv3YBD5?usp=sharing) document in the course folder.
