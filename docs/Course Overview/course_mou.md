# Memorandum of Understanding for this course

*Taken from [this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZOA7QEzD44_13SDbEpnp-eDLvNhItiuVloEiIdYIBhI/edit?usp=sharing) page in the course folder.*

* [   ] I will actively brainstorm and try to figure out how I can learn more from the time I have allocated to this course, rather than waiting to be told what to do.
* [   ] I recognize that Learning can be *very effective* when it is [uncomfortable](https://hbr.org/2019/08/learning-is-supposed-to-feel-uncomfortable). When I am uncomfortable and uncertain and confused, when things seem new, strange, disorganized and there is no clear plan, that this is an opportunity for me to learn.
* [   ] I will make an effort to reach out and connect with my classmates, to socialize, to ask for help, to give help, to see how I can help them and how they can help me.
* [   ] I will make an effort to engage classmates that might seem shy or reluctant to speak up.
* [   ] I will share my opinions and 'User Perspective" with the rest of the class (and the instructor, TAs) about how I experience elements of the class, and my hypotheses about how it might be designed differently. I will do this with the understanding I am just trying to help and these ideas don't need to be "right" and may not always be followed, as there are many Tensions in design goals. I will not be upset if this does not happen, simply inquire and ask questions.
* [   ] I will not 'vandalize' the course, do things that make it harder for other people to feel comfortable and enjoy the course. For example, I will not abuse the privileges and responsibility I've been given in a crowdsourced course by modifying/messing with documents or other people's comments.
* [   ] What else did you all take away from the course today? What else would be useful to add?
