## Overview of this Strange, Radically Different, Crowdsourced Course: Human-Computer Interaction

This course helps you learn skills for better understanding and enhancing the way Humans interact with Computers. This includes exploring the Psychology of how Humans think and feel (whether or not technology is present), and exploring the Design of Technology and the Affordances/Capacities of Computers. This course should help you be more prepared to enter the working world or a graduate program.

This course will be radically different from other courses you have taken, and the previous offerings.

Why? When you get into the working world or go to graduate school, *you* have to play a much larger role in structuring and guiding the design of your learning, in designing the interacting/collaborating with people (managers, coworkers, others) to test out ways to better achieve your professional/personal goals, as well as theirs.

*Student Summary*: "The loose structure is part of the experience, and Joseph wants us to develop techniques to help deal with concerns and anxiety from lack of direction. This is modeling the real world to a certain extent because a lot of the time you will embark on a task or project without close direction or detailed instructions from bosses."
How will the course structure help prepare you?

> Substantive Involvement in being a co-designer and crowdsourced design of how this course will run. A central part of HCI is *Design*, also referred to as "Design Thinking", adopting a Designer Mindset, with respect to "Solving Problems" by testing out Prototypes, articulating Design Goals, and doing Evaluation by observing what happens. Therefore, this course will give you practice every week and in all course & graded activities to let you get better at the skill of Design Thinking. For example, in trying to "Crowdsource" design of how this class will run, in putting together digital learning resources, and other ways to make this experience better for everyone.

You will learn how to proactively take a role in co-designing and 'community-sourcing' a seminar that is run more like a research group, so that you think creatively about how to manage yourself and others, in helping the entire class learn effectively.

> Teaching you MetaSkills useful for doing research and professional success more broadly: For examples of MetaSkills:

Metaskills (tiny.cc/teachmetaskills)
(a) How to apply Design Thinking to
(i) coming up with research problems,
(ii) choosing which research directions to pursue,
(iii) giving excellent presentations,
(iv) creating digital learning resources & activities for others
(b) How to digitally capture & organize knowledge
(c) How to proactively manage yourself and other people to facilitate effective
discussion instead of passively waiting for people to tell you what to do
(d) How to think creatively and systematically about how to make a seminar
accomplish very different goals from the typical "learn X concepts and read Y
papers".
(e) How to manage your emotions and influence your thinking using techniques like
Cognitive Behavior Therapy
(f) Howtobettermanageconflict/tensions/disagreementssotheycanturninto
productive outcomes and insights, build stronger relationships versus damaging
relationships
(g) How to engage in coaching of yourself and peers

> Helping you connect with each other socially, professionally. Making new friends is a key DESIGN GOAL of this course! :D

> What else would you all like to get out of this course?

How to become qualified as a designer?

How to deal with a boss without a good design sense? What stats should we really know for industry?
